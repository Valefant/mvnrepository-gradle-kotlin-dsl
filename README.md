# mvnrepository-gradle-kotlin-dsl
A small user script showing the dependency import as gradle kotlin dsl

## Motivation
I always copied the Gralde version and ajusted it manually to the gradle kotlin dsl syntax.<br>
This was cumbersome and therefore I created this user script. :smiley:

## Example
Here an example for: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.30
